# Aliens

## How to run the program?

* The URI to database instance should be set in aliens/__init__.py file(17 line)
* The backend server providing API should be running. To run the backend server, first install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Then run ```flask run``` or 
```python wsgi.py```
* Run frontend server via npm ```npm run start``` (should be in aliens/frontend folder and, obviously, npm package manager should be installed)
